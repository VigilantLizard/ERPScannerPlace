# ERP Group Scanner Place
Use this to update the MFD ERP list in AccountList in ReplicatedStorage: https://github.com/VigilantLizard/ERPListParser

### To use the release, open Roblox Studio and...
1. Open the place file (`ERPScanKit.rbxl`).
2. Go to the Workspace and open the `ERP Scanner` Script.
3. Change `scanGroups` and `targetGroupId` as you desire.
4. Test the place and watch the console for results.

## Other Notes
Of course, this tool will take longer to scan groups depending on how manu members are in the group, so get some snacks while you're at it.
If the user's entry is yellow in the console, that means it is extremely likely (not guaranteed due to censorship) to be an MFD-confirmed ERP account. Otherwise, it's an account simply in an ERP group or followed by my account.

### [DM or @ me with any other known ERP groups or users on Twitter](https://x.com/VigilantLizard) if:
- [My Roblox account](https://www.roblox.com/users/7506583559/profile) is not in the group.
- The group is not in [the database](https://github.com/VigilantLizard/ERPLists) (private or increased security).
- [My Roblox account](https://www.roblox.com/users/7506583559/friends#!/following) does not follow the user.
- They are not on the MFD ERP account list.
