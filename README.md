## Other Notes
Of course, this tool will take longer to scan groups depending on how manu members are in the group, so get some snacks while you're at it.
If the user's entry is yellow in the console, that means it is extremely likely (not guaranteed due to censorship) to be an MFD-confirmed ERP account. Otherwise, it's an account simply in an ERP group or followed by my account.

### [DM me with any other known ERP groups or users on Twitter](https://x.com/VigilantLizard) if:
- [My Roblox account](https://www.roblox.com/users/7506583559/profile) is not in the group.
- [My Roblox account](https://www.roblox.com/users/7506583559/profile) does not follow the user.
- They are not on the MFD ERP account list.
